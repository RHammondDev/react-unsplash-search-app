 # Project Title: react-unsplash-search-app

Project Description:  

This application uses the Unsplash API to search for photos and returns the first 20 results. This app was created based upon the following tutorial https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-an-image-search-app-in-react/. I added an event handler so that the enter button may be used to submit the query as well as updated the client rendering API code to the React 18 syntax. I created this app to practice my React and API skills.
